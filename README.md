# Welcome to My GitHub! 🚀

Hey! I’m Robert Polishchuk, an Applied Mathematics major with a Computing Science minor at the University of Alberta. I enjoy quantitative analysis, actuarial modeling and risk assesment using programming tools to model uncertainty, analyze markets and turn raw data into meaningful insights.
